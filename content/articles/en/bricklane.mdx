excerpt: "London's Brick Lane was once the heart of Bengali Britain. Now, with curry houses closing and rents rising, a generation asks: where does adda go when the addakhana disappears?"

The neon signs still say "Banglatown." The street signs are still in Bengali script. But walk down Brick Lane on a Tuesday afternoon and the story tells itself in closed shutters and "To Let" signs where curry houses used to be.

Alauddin's has been here since 1974. The Formica tables are the same ones where Altab Ali's friends gathered after his murder in '78, where the Bangladesh Youth Movement planned their marches, where three generations of Sylhetis debated politics over plates of rice that cost less than a bus fare.

Now the landlord wants four times the rent.

## The Original Addakhana

Before Brick Lane was a tourist destination, before the street art and the vintage shops and the Sunday market, it was simply where Bengalis lived. The restaurants weren't competing for Michelin stars — they were community living rooms.

Adda — that untranslatable Bengali concept, somewhere between conversation, debate, and collective time-wasting elevated to art — happened naturally. You didn't plan adda. You sat down, someone brought cha, and four hours disappeared.

The menu was secondary. The real offering was belonging. A place where your accent wasn't foreign, where the cricket scores that mattered were Bangladesh's, where homesickness could be spoken aloud without explanation.

## The Economics of Erasure

The numbers are stark. In 2000, Brick Lane had over 50 Bangladeshi restaurants. Today, fewer than 20 remain. The ones that survive do so by adapting — smaller menus, delivery apps, Instagram-friendly presentations that would mystify the uncles who started these places.

> "My father came here with nothing and built this restaurant with his hands. Now they tell me the area has been 'regenerated.' Regenerated from what? From us?" — Kamal Hussain, second-generation restaurant owner

The irony cuts deep. The very culture that made Brick Lane interesting — the call to prayer mixing with bhangra, the smell of spices drifting into the street, the uncles arguing on corners — that culture is being priced out by people who came for the "authentic experience."

## What Remains

But Bengalis are nothing if not adaptable. The adda hasn't died — it's migrated. To WhatsApp groups and Zoom calls. To kitchens in Whitechapel and living rooms in Barking. To the car park of the East London Mosque after Jummah.

The younger generation does adda differently. In Shoreditch coffee shops that charge what their grandparents earned in a day. In university common rooms. On Twitter threads about identity and belonging that are, in their way, the most Bengali thing imaginable — passionate, verbose, and fundamentally optimistic.

## A Sunday on the Lane

I spend a Sunday on Brick Lane, trying to find the old rhythm.

At Gram Bangla, the buffet is unchanged — the exact dal and begun bhaja of a Dhaka home kitchen. An elderly man eats alone by the window, slowly, watching the street he's watched for forty years. The people have changed. The walk is the same.

Outside, a tour guide explains the "rich multicultural history" of the area to a group of tourists. He mentions the Bengali community in the past tense.

At the Shahporan Mosque, the afternoon prayer call mixes with a busker's guitar. A woman in a hijab sells jilapi from a cart. Two boys on bikes argue about Arsenal in Sylheti-accented English.

The neon still flickers. The story isn't over. It's just being written in a different hand now, by people who refuse to become history while they're still very much alive.

The addakhana may close. But adda? Adda is ours. It goes where we go. And we're not going anywhere.
