Welcome to the inaugural issue of **Probashferry**.

This magazine was born from a simple observation: Bengalis abroad carry their culture with them — in the recipes they cook, the songs they hum on foreign trains, the way they slip into Bangla mid-sentence with anyone who'll understand.

Yet there was no single place that collected these stories. No magazine that held a mirror to the probashi experience — the joys, the contradictions, the quiet grief of distance, the pride of building something new far from home.

## What's Inside

In this issue, we walk through Brick Lane's shuttered curry houses and ask what happens when the places that anchored a community begin to disappear. We visit a Durga Puja in New York City where homesickness becomes devotion. We share photographs from the streets of Kolkata, comics that find humour in code and cats, and art that reimagines the Bengali visual tradition.

## Why "Probashferry"?

*Probash* (প্রবাস) means living abroad, away from your homeland. We added *ferry* because every diaspora story is a crossing — between languages, between cultures, between the person you were and the person you're becoming. This magazine is the boat.

## An Invitation

Probashferry is not a finished thing. It's an invitation. We want your stories, your photographs, your poems written at 2 a.m. when the homesickness hits. If you've ever felt caught between two worlds, this magazine is for you.

Thank you for reading.

*— The Probashferry Team*
