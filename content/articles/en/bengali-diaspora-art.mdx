    artist: "Jamini Roy"
    medium: "Tempera on card"
    caption: "Roy's bold, folk-inspired vision of the divine mother and child — flat planes of colour, thick outlines, and a deliberate rejection of Western academic painting. Bengal reimagined through its own visual grammar."

    title: "Two Cats Holding a Large Prawn"
    artist: "Jamini Roy"
    medium: "Tempera on card"
    caption: "Whimsy and precision in equal measure. Roy's cats are not decorative — they are Bengal itself, rendered in the Kalighat pat tradition that he spent a lifetime channelling into modern Indian art."
